//////// Open Telemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source standard for distributed tracing, which allows you to collect and analyze data about 
the performance of your systems. MassTransit can be configured to use OpenTelemetry to instrument message handling, so 
that you can collect telemetry data about messages as they flow through your system.

By using OpenTelemetry with MassTransit, you can gain insights into the performance of your systems, which can help you 
to identify and troubleshoot issues, and to improve the overall performance of your application.
