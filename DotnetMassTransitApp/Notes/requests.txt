Request/response is a commonly used message pattern where one service sends a request to another service, continuing after 
the response is received. In a distributed system, this can increase the latency of an application since the service may 
be hosted in another process, on another machine, or may even be a remote service in another network. While in many cases it 
is best to avoid request/response use in distributed applications, particularly when the request is a command, it is 
often necessary and preferred over more complex solutions.

In MassTransit, developers use a request client to send or publish requests and wait for a response. The request client 
is asynchronous, and supports use of the await keyword since it returns a Task.
