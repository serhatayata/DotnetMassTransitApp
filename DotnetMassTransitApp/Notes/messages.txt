//////// Commands (Generally used for one-to-one)

A command tells a service to do something, and typically a command should only be consumed by a single consumer. If you have a command, such as SubmitOrder, then you should have only one consumer that implements IConsumer<SubmitOrder> or one saga state machine with the Event<SubmitOrder> configured. By maintaining the one-to-one relationship of a command to a consumer, commands may be published and they will be automatically routed to the consumer.

When using RabbitMQ, there is no additional overhead using this approach. However, both Azure Service Bus and Amazon SQS have a more complicated routing structure and because of that structure, additional charges may be incurred since messages need to be forwarded from topics to queues. For low- to medium-volume message loads this isn't a major concern, but for larger high-volume loads it may be preferable to send (using Send) commands directly to the queue to reduce latency and cost.
Commands should be expressed in a verb-noun sequence, following the tell style. For example:

- UpdateCustomerAddress
- UpgradeCustomerAccount
- SubmitOrder




//////// Events

An event signifies that something has happened. Events are published (using Publish) via either ConsumeContext (within a message consumer), IPublishEndpoint (within a container scope), or IBus (standalone).

Events should be expressed in a noun-verb (past tense) sequence, indicating that something happened. Some example event names may include:

- CustomerAddressUpdated
- CustomerAccountUpgraded
- OrderSubmitted, OrderAccepted, OrderRejected, OrderShipped




//////// Message Headers

MassTransit encapsulates every sent or published message in a message envelope (described by the Envelope Wrapper pattern). The envelope adds a series of message headers

- MessageId
- CorrelationId
- RequestId
- InitiatorId
- ConversationId
- SourceAddress
- DestinationAddress
- ResponseAddress
- FaultAddress
- ExpirationTime
- SentTime
- MessageType
- Host
- Headers

Message headers can be read using the ConsumeContext interface and specified using the SendContext interface.




//////// Message Correlation

Messages are usually part of a conversation and identifiers are used to connect messages to that conversation. In the previous section, the headers supported by MassTransit, including ConversationId, CorrelationId, and InitiatorId, are used to combine separate messages into a conversation. Outbound messages that are published or sent by a consumer will have the same ConversationId as the consumed message. If the consumed message has a CorrelationId, that value will be copied to the InitiatorId. These headers capture the flow of messages involved in the conversation.

CorrelationId may be set, when appropriate, by the developer publishing or sending a message. CorrelationId can be set explicitly on the PublishContext or SendContext or when using a message initializer via the __CorrelationId property. The example below shows how either of these methods can be used.

Here's how it works:

Message Correlation: When one message triggers another message or a series of related messages, you can assign the same CorrelationId to all of them. This allows you to identify which messages are related to each other.

Tracking: The CorrelationId acts as a sort of tracking identifier. It allows you to trace the path of a message as it moves through different services or components of your system. For example, if you have a request-response pattern, you can use the CorrelationId to match responses back to the original request.

Error Handling: In case of errors or exceptions occurring during message processing, having a CorrelationId allows you to track down the entire chain of messages that led to the error, making debugging and troubleshooting easier.




//////// Correlation Conventions

CorrelationId can also be set by convention. MassTransit includes several conventions by default, which may be used as the source to initialize the CorrelationId header.

If the message implements the CorrelatedBy<Guid> interface, which has a Guid CorrelationId property, its value will be used.
If the message has a property named CorrelationId, CommandId, or EventId that is a Guid or Guid?, its value will be used.
If the developer registered a CorrelationId provider for the message type, it will be used get the value.

//////// Saga Correlation

Sagas must have a CorrelationId, it is the primary key used by the saga repository and the way messages are correlated to a specific saga instance. MassTransit follows the conventions above to obtain the CorrelationId used to create a new or load an existing saga instance. Newly created saga instances will be assigned the CorrelationId from the initiating message.





//////// Identifiers

MassTransit uses and highly encourages the use of Guid identifiers. Distributed systems would crumble using monotonically incrementing identifiers (such as int or long) due to the bottleneck of locking and incrementing a shared counter. Historically, certain types (okay, we'll call them out - SQL DBAs) have argued against using Guid (or, their term, uniqueidentifier) as a key – a clustered primary key in particular. However, with MassTransit, we solved that problem.

MassTransit uses NewId to generate identifiers that are unique, sequential, and represented as a Guid. The generated identifiers are clustered-index friendly, and are ordered so that SQL Server can efficiently insert them into a database with the uniqueidentifier as the primary key.

To create a Guid, call NewId.NextGuid() where you would otherwise call Guid.NewGuid() and enjoy the benefits of fast, distributed unique identifiers.




//////// Guidance

- When defining message contracts, what follows is general guidance based upon years of using MassTransit combined with continued questions raised by developers new to MassTransit.

- Use records, define properties as public and specify { get; init; } accessors. Create messages using the constructor/object initializer or a message initializer.

- Use interfaces, specify only { get; } accessors. Create messages using message initializers and use the Roslyn Analyzer to identify missing or incompatible properties.

- Limit the use of inheritance, pay attention to polymorphic message routing. A message type containing a dozen interfaces is a bit annoying to untangle if you need to delve deep into message routing to troubleshoot an issue.

- Class inheritance has the same guidance as interfaces, but with more caution.

- Message design is not object-oriented design. Messages should contain state, not behavior. Behavior should be in a separate class or service.

- Consuming a base class type, and expecting polymorphic method behavior almost always leads to problems.

- A big base class may cause pain down the road as changes are made, particularly when supporting multiple message versions.




//////// Message Inheritance

This concept comes up often enough that it warrants its own special section. By design, MassTransit treats your classes, records, and interfaces as a "contract".

If you try and consume a Batch<CoreEvent> and expect to get a variety of types, one of which would be SubmitOrder. In OOP land, that makes all the sense in the world, but in MassTransit contract design it does not. The application has said that it cares about batches of CoreEvent so it will only get back the single property User. This is not a symptom of using System.Text.Json, this has been the standard behavior of MassTransit since day one, even when using Netwonsoft.Json. MassTransit will always respect the contract that has been designed.

If you want to have a standard set of properties available, by all means use a base class, or bundle them up into a single property, our preference. If you want to subscribe to all implementations of class, then you will need to subscribe to all implementations of a class.
