When a message is delivered to the consumer, the consumer throws an exception. With a default bus configuration, the 
exception is caught by middleware in the transport (the ErrorTransportFilter to be exact), and the message is moved to an 
_error queue (prefixed by the receive endpoint queue name). The exception details are stored as headers with the message 
for analysis and to assist in troubleshooting the exception.

//////// Retry

Some exceptions may be caused by a transient condition, such as a database deadlock, a busy web service, or some similar type 
of situation which usually clears up on a second attempt. With these exception types, it is often desirable to retry the 
message delivery to the consumer, allowing the consumer to try the operation again.

The UseMessageRetry method is an extension method that configures a middleware filter, in this case the RetryFilter. 

MassTransit retry filters execute in memory and maintain a lock on the message. As such, they should only be used to 
handle short, transient error conditions. Setting a retry interval of an hour would fall into the category of bad things. 
To retry messages after longer waits, look at the next section on redelivering messages. For example, if a consumer with 
a concurrency limit of 5 and a retry interval of one hour consumes 5 messages that causes retries, the consumer will 
be effectively stalled for a whole hour as all the concurrent message slots are in use waiting for the retry interval.


//////// Exception Filters

Sometimes you do not want to always retry, but instead only retry when some specific exception is thrown and fault for all 
other exceptions. To implement this, you can use an exception filter. Specify exception types using either the Handle or 
Ignore method. A filter can have either Handle or Ignore statements, combining them has unpredictable effects.

Both methods have two signatures:

- Generic version Handle<T> and Ignore<T> where T must be derivate of System.Exception. With no argument, all exceptions of specified type will be either handled or ignored. You can also specify a function argument that will filter exceptions further based on other parameters.
- Non-generic version that needs one or more exception types as parameters. No further filtering is possible if this version is used.

//////// Redelivery

Some errors take a while to resolve, say a remote service is down or a SQL server has crashed. In these situations, it's best 
to dust off and nuke the site from orbit - at a much later time obviously. Redelivery is a form of retry (some refer to it 
as second-level retry) where the message is removed from the queue and then redelivered to the queue at a future time.

To use delayed redelivery, ensure the transport is properly configured. RabbitMQ required a delayed-exchange plug-in, 
and ActiveMQ (non-Artemis) requires the scheduler to be enabled via the XML configuration.

MassTransit also supports scheduled redelivery using the UseScheduledRedelivery configuration method. Scheduled 
redelivery requires the use of a message scheduler, which can be configured to use the message transport or 
Quartz.NET/Hangfire. The configuration is similar, just ensure the scheduler is properly configured.

However, in most cases using UseDelayedRedelivery (as configured above) is preferred to avoid overloading the scheduler 
with delayed redeliveries that typically have short redelivery times, leaving the scheduler free to do things like 
actual scheduling of messages.


//////// Outbox

Outbox pattern is a feature used to ensure that message publishing and database operations are atomic, meaning they 
either succeed or fail together. This pattern is particularly useful in distributed systems where you need to maintain 
data consistency across multiple services and databases.

If the consumer publishes events or sends messages (using ConsumeContext, which is provided via the Consume method on 
the consumer) and subsequently throws an exception, it isn't likely that those messages should still be published or 
sent. MassTransit provides an outbox to buffer those messages until the consumer completes successfully. If an exception 
is thrown, the buffered messages are discarded.


///////// Configuring for a consumer or saga

If there are multiple consumers (or saga) on the same endpoint (which could potentially get you on the naughty list), and 
the retry/redelivery behavior should only apply to a specific consumer or saga, the same configuration can be 
applied specifically to the consumer or saga.

//////// Faults

MassTransit delivers messages to consumers by calling the Consume method. When a message consumer throws an exception instead 
of returning normally, a Fault<T> is produced, which may be published or sent depending upon the context.

A Fault<T> is a generic message contract including the original message that caused the consumer to fail, as well as 
the ExceptionInfo, HostInfo, and the time of the exception.

If the message headers specify a FaultAddress, the fault is sent directly to that address. If the FaultAddress is not 
present, but a ResponseAddress is specified, the fault is sent to the response address. Otherwise, the fault is 
published, allowing any subscribed consumers to receive it.

//////// Consuming Faults

Developers may want to do something with faults, such as updating an operational dashboard. To observe faults separate of 
the consumer that caused the fault to be produced, a consumer can consume fault messages the same as any other message.


//////// Error Pipe

By default, MassTransit will move faulted messages to the _error queue. This behavior can be customized for each receive endpoint.

- GenerateFaultFilter: GenerateFaultFilter is a filter that generates fault messages for exceptions that occur during 
message processing. When a consumer encounters an exception while processing a message, MassTransit generates a fault 
message containing information about the exception and sends it to the error queue. This allows for centralized error 
handling and monitoring.

- ErrorTransportFilter: ErrorTransportFilter is a filter that manages the transportation of error messages to the error 
queue. It ensures that fault messages are properly transported to the designated error queue for further processing 
and analysis. This filter handles the logistics of routing error messages and ensures that they are not lost in transit.
