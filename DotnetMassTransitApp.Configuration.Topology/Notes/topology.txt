In MassTransit, Topology is how message types are used to configure broker topics (exchanges in RabbitMQ) and queues. 

Topology is also used to access specific broker capabilities, such as RabbitMQ direct exchanges and routing keys.

Topology is separate from the send, publish, and consume pipelines which are focused more on middleware inside 
MassTransit. Topology allows conventions to be created that can apply message-specific topology configuration at runtime 
as messages are published and sent.

//////// Bus

Once the bus is created, access to topology is via the Topology property on IBus. The message, publish, and send topologies 
are accessible on this interface. It is also possible to retrieve a message's publish address. The Topology property may 
support other interfaces, such as a transport-specific host topology.

//////// Send

Topology does not cover sending messages beyond delivering messages to a queue. MassTransit sends messages via a send 
endpoint, which is retrieved using the endpoint's address only.

The exception to this is when the transport supports additional capabilities on send, such as the partitioning of messages. 
With RabbitMQ this would include specifying the RoutingKey, and with Azure Service Bus this would include specifying 
the PartitionId or the SessionId.

Topology cannot alter the destination of a message, only the properties of the message delivery itself. Determining the path 
of a message is routing, which is handled separately.

//////// Publish

Topology is a key part of publishing messages, and is responsible for how the broker's facilities are configured.

The publish topology defines many aspects of broker configuration, including:
- RabbitMQ Exchange names or Azure Service Bus Topic names
  - Formatted, based upon the message type
  - Explicit, based upon the configuration
- RabbitMQ Exchange Bindings or Azure Service Bus Topic Subscriptions
When Publish is called, the topology is also used to:
- Populate the RoutingKey of the message sent to the RabbitMQ exchange
- Populate the PartitionId or SessionId of the message sent to the Azure Service Bus topic

//////// Consume

Each receive endpoint has a consume topology, which is configured as consumers are added. Depending upon the 
transport, additional methods may be available to support exchange bindings, topic subscriptions, etc.

Consume topology uses the publish topology to ensure consistent naming of exchanges/topics for message types.


//////// Message Topology

Message types are extensively leveraged in MassTransit, so making it easy to configure how those message types are used 
by topology seemed obvious.

//////// Entity Name Formatters
///// Message Type

MassTransit has built-in defaults for naming messaging entities (these are things like exchanges, topics, etc.). The 
defaults can be overridden as well. For instance, to change the topic name used by a message, just do it!


//////// Attributes

//// EntityName
EntityName is an optional attribute used to override the default entity name for a message type. If present, the entity 
name will be used when creating the topic or exchange for the message.

//// ConfigureConsumeTopology

ConfigureConsumeTopology is an optional attribute that may be specified on a message type to indicate whether the topic 
or exchange for the message type should be created and subscribed to the queue when consumed on a receive endpoint.

- ConfigureConsumeTopology(true) (default): This setting means that MassTransit will automatically configure the 
necessary consume topology for the message type.

- ConfigureConsumeTopology(false): This setting tells MassTransit not to configure any topology for the message type, which 
can be useful in scenarios where you want to manually manage the broker's infrastructure or when using certain 
advanced configurations.

//// ExcludeFromTopology

The ExcludeFromTopology attribute in MassTransit is used to indicate that a message type should not be included in the 
automatic topology configuration. This means that when this attribute is applied to a message type, MassTransit will 
not automatically create exchanges, queues, or bindings for this message type when configuring the broker's topology.


//////// Topology Conventions

Conventions are used to apply topology to messages without requiring explicit configuration of every message type.

A basic example of a convention is the default CorrelationId convention, which is automatically applied to all sent messages. 
As message types are sent, the convention is used to determine if the message contains a property that could be considered 
a CorrelationId, and uses that property to set the CorrelationId header on the message envelope.

//////// Deploy Topology

In MassTransit, the "deploy topology" refers to the process and configuration for setting up the necessary infrastructure on 
the message broker (such as RabbitMQ) to support messaging between producers and consumers. This includes creating 
exchanges, queues, and bindings as defined by the configuration and conventions.

Tabii ki, MassTransit'de "deploy topology" (topoloji dağıtımı), mesaj göndericileri (producers) ve alıcılar (consumers) arasında mesajlaşmayı desteklemek için mesaj broker'ında (örneğin RabbitMQ) gerekli altyapının kurulması ve yapılandırılması sürecini ifade eder. Bu, tanımlanan yapılandırma ve kurallara göre değişimlerin, kuyrukların ve bağlamaların (bindings) oluşturulmasını içerir.

//// Topoloji Dağıtımının Temel Kavramları
- Exchanges: Routing mechanisms where producers send messages. Exchanges can be of different types, such as direct, fanout, 
topic, or headers.
	
- Queues: Storage for messages until they are consumed. Consumers read messages from queues.

- Bindings: Links between exchanges and queues that determine how messages are routed from exchanges to queues based on routing 
keys or other criteria.

- Message Types: Different types of messages can be configured to have specific exchanges, queues, and bindings.

//// Deploy Topology Process
The deploy topology process in MassTransit involves automatically creating or updating the necessary exchanges, queues, and 
bindings based on the message types and configuration provided by the developer. This is done to ensure that the 
infrastructure required for message routing and handling is in place before any messages are sent or consumed.

//// Configuring Topology in MassTransit
MassTransit provides various configuration options to control how the topology is deployed. Here's a summary of some 
important aspects:

- Automatic Topology Configuration
By default, MassTransit automatically configures the topology based on the message types and endpoints you define. This 
includes creating exchanges and queues with names derived from the message types.

- Excluding Messages from Topology
You can exclude certain messages from the topology configuration if you want to manage those manually. This is done using 
the ExcludeFromTopology attribute or specific configuration settings.

- Deploy topology refers to the process of setting up exchanges, queues, and bindings in the message broker.
- Automatic configuration ensures necessary infrastructure is created based on message types and endpoint configurations.
- Customization allows specifying names and settings for exchanges and queues.
- Exclusion can be used to manually manage certain parts of the topology.
- Manual deployment provides control over when the topology is set up.

//// Benefits of Using DeployTopologyAsync

- Ensures Readiness: Guarantees that the necessary RabbitMQ infrastructure is in place before any message processing begins.
- Error Handling: Allows for handling any topology deployment errors separately from message processing logic.
- Environment Setup: Useful for setting up and tearing down environments, especially in automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.
