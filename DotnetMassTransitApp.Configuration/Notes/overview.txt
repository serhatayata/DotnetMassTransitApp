To consume messages, one or more consumers must be added and receive endpoints configured for the added consumers. 
MassTransit connects each receive endpoint to a queue on the message broker.

To add a consumer and automatically configure a receive endpoint for the consumer, call one of the AddConsumer methods and 
call ConfigureEndpoints

MassTransit will automatically configure a receive endpoint for the SubmitOrderConsumer using the name returned by the 
configured endpoint name formatter. When the bus is started, the receive endpoint will be started and messages will be 
delivered from the queue by the transport to an instance of the consumer.

All consumer types can be added, including consumers, sagas, saga state machines, and routing slip activities. If a job consumer 
is added, additional configuration is required.

To exclude a consumer, saga, or routing slip activity from automatic configuration, use the ExcludeFromConfigureEndpoints

//////// Configure Endpoints

As shown in the example above, using ConfigureEndpoints is the preferred approach to configure receive endpoints. By 
registering consumers, sagas, and routing slip activities along with their optional definitions, MassTransit is able to 
configure receive endpoints for all registered consumer types. Receive endpoint names are generated using an endpoint name 
formatter (unless otherwise specified in a definition), and each receive endpoint is configured.

As receive endpoints are configured, one or more consumer types are configured on each receive endpoint. If multiple consumer 
types share the same endpoint name, those consumer types will be configured on the same receive endpoint. For each consumer 
type, its respective consumer, saga, or activity definition will be applied to the receive endpoint.

If multiple consumer types share the same receive endpoint, and more than one of those consumer types have a matching 
definition that specifies the same middleware component, multiple filters may be configured! This may lead to unpredictable 
results, so caution is advised when configuring multiple consumer types on the same receive endpoint.

//////// Configure Endpoints Callback

To apply receive endpoint settings or configure middleware for all receive endpoints configured by ConfigureEndpoints, a 
callback can be added.

When ConfigureEndpoints is called, any registered callbacks will be called for every recieve endpoint endpoint. Each callback 
will only be called once per receive endpoint.

To conditionally apply transport-specific settings, the cfg parameter can be pattern-matched to the transport type as shown below.
